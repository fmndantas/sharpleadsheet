## Why SharpLeadsheet?

**Other text-based music notation tools** like [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/), [ABC Notation](https://abcnotation.com/), and [MusicXML](https://www.w3.org/2021/06/musicxml40/) are powerful and feature-rich, but they come with complexity.

**SharpLeadsheet is different: it focuses on simplicity!**
