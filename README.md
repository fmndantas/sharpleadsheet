## SharpLeadsheet

---

SharpLeadsheet is a **CLI (Command Line Interface)** tool for rapidly converting plain text musical notation into **MusicXML** files. 
Our goal is to offer a simple and intuitive input syntax, combined with clear and helpful user feedback.

## Why SharpLeadsheet?

**Other text-based music notation tools** like [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/), [ABC Notation](https://abcnotation.com/), and [MusicXML](https://www.w3.org/2021/06/musicxml40/) are powerful and feature-rich, but they come with complexity.

**SharpLeadsheet is different: it's optimized for simplicity.**

### Design Philosophy

- **Minimal syntax** - Write `c4 d8 e r` instead of verbose XML or complex markup
- **Lead sheet focused** - Built specifically for jazz, pop, and rhythm charts
- **No learning curve** - If you can read music, you can write SharpLeadsheet
- **Fast workflow** - From text to MusicXML in seconds

### Perfect For

- Quick lead sheet transcriptions
- Rhythm charts for rehearsals
- Simple arrangements (1-4 parts)
- Musicians who prefer CLI tools
